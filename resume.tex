  \textbf{Automatically Identifying Performance Optimizations in jQuery JavaScript Applications}\vspace{2mm}\\
  \textsl{Paper} \hfill \textbf{Draft}\\
  ACM proceedings format for publication with motivating statistics, a detailed treatment of two categories, Html and Jqry, with a discussion of the a sample implementation of a library to alert users to possible optimizations. Further work will require project specific performance data, a standard proposal to the jQuery project, and comparisons with existing loop fusion optimizations in other languages/domains.\vspace{1mm}\\
  \textsl{Poster} \hfill \textbf{Submitted OOPSLA - October 2012}\\
  Large format poster with jQuery usage statistics, example use of category theory in identifying optimization candidates, the proposed standard, and a information on a sample library implementation.\vspace{1mm}\\
  \textsl{Presentation} \hfill \textbf{LA JavaScript, JQCONSF - May, June 2012}\\
  Half to one whole hour introduction to category theory, overview of proposed standard, and sample optimizations. The target audience is the jQuery Core development team and advanced jQuery developers.
  \vspace{1mm}\\
  \textsl{Essays} \hfill \textbf{February, March 2012}\\
  Two essays covering both Html and Jqry as categories, a functor that maps from Html to Jqry, a natural transformation from another functor to the first, and the implications in every day use of jQuery

  \textbf{Middleware as a General Purpose Abstraction}\vspace{2mm}\\
  \textsl{Presentation} \hfill \textbf{LARUBYCONF - February 2012}\\
  Half hour review of foundations in WSGI middleware, examples of generality in existing software, and sample refactoring based on generic ``middleware'' in a popular Ruby application.
  \vspace{1mm}\\
  \textsl{Essays} \hfill \textbf{July, October 2010}\\
  Two essays discussing similarities in middleware composition to function composition and the Monad abstractions present in Haskell, including an implementation in the Vagrant command line tool.\vspace{1mm}\\
